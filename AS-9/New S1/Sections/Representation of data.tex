Note the following terms:

\begin{itemize}

	\item qualitative data
	
	
	$\underline{\hspace{3cm}}$ or $\underline{\hspace{3cm}}$  are often used to show the information.
	\item quantitative data (numerical values)
	
	There are two types:  $\underline{\hspace{3cm}}$ and $\underline{\hspace{3cm}}$.
	
	
	\item frequency distribution
	
	Case $1$:
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	Case $2$:
	
	
	\item class boundry, interval width

\subsection{Stem-and-leaf diagram}

A way of grouping data into intervals while still retaining  the original data is to draw a \textbf{stem-and-leaf diagram}. 

\vspace{5 pt}


For example, there are 20 students in an assignment, their marks are as follows:
\vspace{5 pt}

\begin{tabular}{cccccccccc}
	\rule[-1ex]{0pt}{2.5ex} 84 & 17 & 38 & 45 & 47 & 53 & 76 & 54 & 75 & 32 \\
	\rule[-1ex]{0pt}{2.5ex} 66 & 65 & 55 & 54 & 51 & 44 & 39 & 19 & 54 & 72 \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{5 pt}
A final plot of stem-and-leaf diagram would be like: 

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	

	
	\begin{tabular}{c|l@{\hspace{4 pt}}l@{\hspace{4 pt}}l@{\hspace{4 pt}}l@{\hspace{4 pt}}l@{\hspace{4 pt}}l@{\hspace{4 pt}} 	c}
		
		Stem & Leaf  & \\

		4     & 4 5 7 & (3)\\    
		5     & 1 3 4 4 4 5 & (6)\\    
		6     & 5 6 & (2)\\

\fbox{ Key: $1 | 1 $ means 17 marks}

\end{table}

\textbf{Important}: You must always give a $\underline{\hspace{2 cm}}$ to explain what the stem and leaf  represent.
\medskip

 Also, $\underline{\hspace{4 cm}}$ must be chosen in a stem-and-leaf diagram.

\bigskip

For two sets of data, $\underline{\hspace{6 cm}}$ is often used to compare the data.

\[
\sum (x-a) = -73.2   \qquad \qquad \sum (x-a)^2 =2115
\]
The mean of these values of $x$ is $8.95$.

\subsection{Cumulative frequency graph}
\smallskip

When a set of data contains extreme values, known as $\underline{\hspace{2 cm}}$, the median is a more informative average and the interquartile range is more-useful measure of spread. 

\medskip

\textbf{Median}: for a set of $n$ numbers arranged in $\underline{\hspace{4 cm}}$.

\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{0.8em}
	\item When $n$ is odd, 
	\item  When $n$ is even,
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Quartiles}:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.8em}
	\item Lower quartile, $Q_1$, 
	\item  Upper quartile, $Q_3$, 
	\item  Interquartile range (IQR), 
\end{itemize}
\bigskip


\textbf{Cumulative frequency}: a total frequency up to a particular item. It is particular useful when finding the median and quartiles. 

\medskip  

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.8em}
	\item Ungrouped data
	\item  grouped data,  class boundaries.

\subsection{Box-and-whisker plots}

In a box-and-whisker plot the median and quartiles are shown, as well as the $\underline{\hspace{2 cm}}$ and $\underline{\hspace{2 cm}}$ values of a distribution.

\medskip

For example, 	a survey on the heights of all the girls in a particular year group 	in a school gave the following information.

\begin{tabular}{lc}
	Minimum height  & 144 cm  \\
	Lower quartile~ & 159 cm  \\
	Median~         & 165 cm  \\
	Upper quartile~ & 169 cm  \\
	Maximum height  & 181 cm 
\end{tabular}

A box-and-whisker plot can be drawn as following:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.8em}
	\item The scale must be $\underline{\hspace{2 cm}}$ and $\underline{\hspace{2 cm}}$.
	\item The whiskers must not be drawn through the box.

\subsection{Choosing measures and diagrams}
When representing data  you need to  consider the ways that would be most  appropriate,

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1.8em}
	\item What type of diagram should you draw?
	\item  Which average best represent the data?
	\item Which measure of spread is most informative?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2cm}
Measure of central tendency:

\begin{table}[!htpb]
	\begin{tabular}{|l|p{6.5cm}|p{6.5cm}|}
		\hline
		& \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages} \\ \hline
		Mode   &  It is useful when the post popular category is needed.          &  Very small data or more than two modes.
		
			 There may not be a mode.
			 
		 Not representative.
		 
			 The modal class depends on the grouping of data.
	           \\ \hline
		Median &     It is not affected by extreme values.       &   Not use the information of the whole data set            \\ \hline
		Mean   &      Use all the data and so represent every item      &    It is affected by one or two extreme values           \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\vspace{2cm}

Measure of spread:

\begin{table}[!htpb]
	\begin{tabular}{|l|p{5.5cm}|p{6cm}|}
		\hline
		& \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages} \\ \hline
		Range   &  Easy to calculate. 
		
		Represent the complete spread of data.
		         &  It can be affected by extreme values.
		\\ \hline
		Interquartile range &     It is not affected by extreme values.       &   It depends only on particular values when the data was ranked.            \\ \hline
		Standard deviation   &      Use all the data and so represent every item.  
		
		It is useful in comparing two sets of data, to show the consistence.
		    &    It is affected by one or two extreme values.           \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\newpage 
Diagrams:

\begin{table}[!htpb]
	\begin{tabular}{|l|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
		\hline
		& \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages} \\ \hline
		
		
		Stem-and-leaf diagram   &  It shows all the original data.
		
		It shows the shape of the distribution.
		
		The mode, median and quartile can be found.
		
		It is useful for comparing two sets of data.
	
		&  It is not suitable for large amount of data.
		\\ \hline
		
		
		Histogram &     It can represent groups of different widths.
		
		It shows whether the distribution is symmetrical or skew
		
		The mean and the standard deviation can be estimated from the histogram.       &   The visual impact can be altered by choosing different groups.
		
		Two distributions cannot be shown on the same diagram.           \\ \hline
		
		
		Cumulative frequency graph   &      The median and quartiles can be estimated the graph.  
		
		Sets of data can be compared by drawing graphs on the same diagram
		&    The visual impact can be altered by using different scales.           \\ \hline
		
		Box-and-whisker plot   &      It is easy to see whether the distribution is symmetrical or whether  there is a tail to the left or right.
		
		It can be used to find the extreme values.
		
		It is easy to see the range and interquartile range.
		
		You can compare two or more sets of data by drawing plots on the same diagram.
		&    It does not show frequencies.           \\ \hline
